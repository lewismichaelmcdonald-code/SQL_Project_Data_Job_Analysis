/*From the job_postings_fact table, categorize the salaries from job postings that are data analyst jobs, and that have yearly salary information. Put salary into 3 different categories:

If the salary_year_avg is greater than or equal to $100,000, then return ‘high salary’.
If the salary_year_avg is greater than or equal to $60,000 but less than $100,000, then return ‘Standard salary.’
If the salary_year_avg is below $60,000 return ‘Low salary’.
Also, order from the highest to the lowest salaries.*/
